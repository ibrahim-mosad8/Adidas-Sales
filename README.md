# Adidas-Sales
🏷️ Adidas Sales Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

In this project, I worked on analyzing Adidas sales data to understand business performance across different regions, products, and sales channels.
The main goal was to turn raw sales numbers into clear insights that can support better business decisions.

I focused on data storytelling — not just numbers, but explaining what is happening and why it is happening.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas for data cleaning and transformation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

Tableau for building interactive dashboards

🧹 Data Preparation

Before starting the analysis, I worked on:

Cleaning missing and inconsistent values

Converting columns to correct data types (dates, numbers)

Preparing calculated fields like:

Total Sales

Operating Profit

Profit Margin

📊 Analysis Process
🔹 Executive Overview

I started with high-level KPIs to understand overall performance:

Total Sales

Total Operating Profit

Total Units Sold

Profit Margin

Then I analyzed:

Sales by Region

Monthly Sales Trend

Sales by Method (Online vs Retail)

This helped answer:
“How is the business performing overall?”

🔹 Deep Dive Analysis

After that, I explored what drives performance:

Sales by Product

Top Retailers

Sales by City

Profit by Product

Relationship between Units Sold and Total Sales

This answered:
“What factors are driving the results?”

📈 Key Insights

Some regions clearly outperform others in total sales.

A few products generate most of the profit.

Sales channels contribute differently to revenue.

Certain cities and retailers have strong sales impact.

🎯 What I Learned

This project improved my skills in:

Data cleaning and preparation

Using Python for analysis

Building dashboards with a clear storyline

Presenting data in a way that decision-makers can easily understand

🚀 Final Output

The final result is a two-page dashboard:

Executive Overview – Overall performance

Deep Dive Analysis – Detailed performance drivers
